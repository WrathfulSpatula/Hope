Statistical fitting for Hough mode extensions

'Hope' is an open-source project by Daniel Strano based on Oberheide and Forbes GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 35, L04816, doi:10.1029/2007GL032397, 2008. The program was originally designed for the purpose of handling the challenge of empirically fitting multi-component complex wave data, in situations where the goodness of fit of a least squares model is questionable. The program was originally designed to work with three self-consistent variables to fit simultaneously. The variances of the variables are first scaled to satisify the assumptions of constant variance and independence of errors, necessary for a consistent least squares model. Then, the program takes advantage of the finite phase domain to indirectly search for a maximization of the sum of absolute (norms of) residuals.

The developer hopes to expand the project into a general statistical fitting application for 'tricky' data to fit, for nonlinear or complex number data fitting requiring generalized statistical moment models.

This program requires 'Apophenia' and the Gnu Scientific Library to be included in order to run. Apophenia is available at http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapophenia.info%2F&ei=UnGOUPnjJOH30gHz94GABw&usg=AFQjCNHL2BZZlONw8_wD3dB7frpn-9fN_A&sig2=s6NOUDOYgSyNwO7OQvLhCg&cad=rja .
