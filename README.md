Statistical fitting for Hough mode extensions

'Hope' is an open-source project by Daniel Strano based on Oberheide and Forbes GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 35, L04816, doi:10.1029/2007GL032397, 2008. The program was originally designed for the purpose of handling the challenge of empirically fitting multi-component complex wave data, in situations where the goodness of fit of a least squares model is questionable. The program was originally designed to work with three self-consistent variables to fit simultaneously. The variances of the variables are first scaled to satisify the assumptions of constant variance and independence of errors, necessary for a consistent least squares model. Then, the program takes advantage of the finite phase domain to indirectly search for a maximization of the sum of absolute (norms of) residuals.

The developer hopes to expand the project into a general statistical fitting application for 'tricky' data to fit, for nonlinear or complex number data fitting requiring generalized statistical moment models.
